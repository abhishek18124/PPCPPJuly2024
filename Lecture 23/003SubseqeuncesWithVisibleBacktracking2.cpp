/*

Given a string of length n, generate all of its subsequences.

A subsequence of a given string (sequence) is a string (sequence) that is generated by
removing zero or more characters from the given string (sequence) without changing its
order.

Example

	Input : inp[] = "abc"
	Output: ["", "c", "b", "bc", "a", "ac", "ab", "abc"]

Constraints

  1 < n < 10

	// index i to n-1 such that the next free index in the out[] is j

	// f(i, j) = generate subsequences for inp[i...n-1] such that the next free index
	// in the out[] is j
